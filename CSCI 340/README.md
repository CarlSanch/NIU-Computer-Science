## CSCI 340 - Data Structures and Algorithms
Instructor: Michael Papka
###### Overview
Application of analysis and design techniques to nonnumeric algorithms acting on data structures. Utilization of algorithmic analysis and design criteria in the selection of methods for data manipulation. Computing projects done in a high-level computing language. Extensive laboratory work.

Programmer's Note: I had previously learned Data Structures and Algorithms before transferring to NIU so this class was not too difficult. Only hurdles were learning to use Linux/UNIX and learning how to code C++ as this was my first semester here.
