## CSCI 330 - Unix and Network Programming
Instructor: Jon Lehuta
###### Overview
UNIX system usage and commands. Shell script programming. Network programming concepts and protocols. System call level and basic network programming in C++. Extensive laboratory work.

Programmer's Note: First class at NIU as a transfer student, was pretty brutal as I had to learn C++ and the programming assignments seemed to ask for a lot, even for those who had taken C++ before. Managed to get a B+ in the class.
