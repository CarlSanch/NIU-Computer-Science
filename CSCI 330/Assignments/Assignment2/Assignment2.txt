1: Root, absolute path is /
2: pwd from q would print /a/e/p/q
3: typing ls from c would give you /k and /i
4: to move the j file into the e directory from d, you would have to type mv /a/c/j /a/e
5: to make a new directory you must type mkdir /a/c/i/v/queso
6: cp /a/c/i/v /a/e/p/r/queso
7: cp -r /a/c /b/g
8: rm -rf /
9: cat /a/c/k /a/c/i/v
10: ln -s /a/e/p/r/s /b/h/g/link : three absolute paths are /b/h/g/link, /a/e/p/r/s and can't figure out the third one
