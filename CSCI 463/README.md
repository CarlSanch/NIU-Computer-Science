## CSCI 463 - Computer Architecture and Systems Organization
Instructor: John Winans
###### Overview
Organization and use of computer systems. Basic concepts and examples from microcomputers and networks, peripheral components, data communications, and the relationship between hardware components and the operating system.

Programmer's Note: And I thought CSCI 360 was tough; I have not seen anything yet. This class has no correlation between what is taught in class and the coding assignments issued (besides Assignment 2). Most assignments have us go through RISC-V Architecture and try to recreate an RV32I Memory Simulator, Disassembler, etc. Very tough class, and the very tough grading too
