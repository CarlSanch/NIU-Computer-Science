1. Do this on our turing computer. Create a file (Employee.java) with a class
named Employee that includes three instance variables —a first name (type
String), a last name (type String) and a monthly salary (double). Provide a
constructor that initializes the three instance variables. Provide a set and a get
method for each instance variable. If the monthly salary is not positive, do not set
its value.
Write a driver/test application named DriverTest.java that demonstrates class
Employee’s capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display each object’s
yearly salary. Then give each Employee a 10% raise and display each Employee’s
yearly salary again.
2.(Date Class) Create a class called Date.java that includes three instance
variables—a month (type int), a day (type int) and a year (type int). Provide a
constructor that initializes the three instance variables and assumes that the values
provided are correct. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable.
Provide a method displayDate that displays the month, day and year separated by
forward slashes (/).
Add to your DriverTest.java more code that tests the Date class that demonstrates
class Date’s capabilities. (Thus, you only have one driver program to submit.)
Run your driver code and produce screen output and turn in screen shots of your
output where you test your classes in a word doc. Also submit your three .java
files as well in blackboard. You can use filezilla to get your .java files off of turing
or use other file download programs
