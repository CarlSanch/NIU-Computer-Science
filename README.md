# Computer Science Degree
This repo contains assignments completed during my time at Northern Illinois University. I am a transfer student from Harper Community College to Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville to Northern Illinois University. I learned Java at my time at SIUe and transferred to NIU. Unfortunately my work from SIUe is lost, so this repo only contains my work as a Junior.
