# Computer Science Degree
This repo contains assignments completed during my time at Northern Illinois University. I am a transfer student from Harper Community College to Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville to Northern Illinois University. I learned Java at my time at SIUe and transferred to NIU. Unfortunately my work from SIUe is lost, so this repo only contains my work as a Junior and Senior. 

## CSCI 330 - Unix and Network Programming
Instructor: Jon Lehuta
(Spring 2020)
###### Overview
UNIX system usage and commands. Shell script programming. Network programming concepts and protocols. System call level and basic network programming in C++. Extensive laboratory work.



## CSCI 340 - Data Structures and Algorithms
Instructor: Michael Papka
(Spring 2020)
###### Overview
Application of analysis and design techniques to nonnumeric algorithms acting on data structures. Utilization of algorithmic analysis and design criteria in the selection of methods for data manipulation. Computing projects done in a high-level computing language. Extensive laboratory work.



## CSCI 360 - Computer Programming in Assembler Language
Instructor: Geoffrey Decker
(Fall 2020)
###### Overview
In-depth study of assembler language programming on a third-generation computer, including internal and external subroutines, conditional assembly, and the macro language. Students required to write a number of substantial programs. Extensive laboratory work.



## CSCI 463 - Computer Architecture and Systems Organization
Instructor: John Winans
(Spring 2021)
###### Overview
Organization and use of computer systems. Basic concepts and examples from microcomputers and networks, peripheral components, data communications, and the relationship between hardware components and the operating system.



## CSCI 466 - Databases
Instructor: Jon Lehuta
(Spring 2021)
###### Overview
Software development in a representative current database system. Extensive laboratory work.



## CSCI 467 - Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructor: Raimund Ege
(Fall 2021)
###### Overview
Phases of the systems development life cycle and the tools used by the analyst in planning, specifying, and implementing a complex computer-based system.

## CSCI 470 - Programming in Java
Instructor: Reva Freedman
(Spring 2022)
###### Overview
Intermediate-level course in object-oriented programming in Java, including multi-threading, graphical applets, and Internet-based distributed client-server database applications. Extensive laboratory work.


## CSCI 490-J - Topics in Computer Science (Visual Analytics)
Instructor: Maoyuan Sun
(Spring 2022)
###### Overview
To tackle the onset of big data, visual analytics seeks to marry human cognition with computational analytical horsepower. The goal of this course is to introduce students the state-of-the-art of theories and models in visual analytics. Student will learn the value of interactive visualizations to support data analytics by leveraging computation with human cognition.


## CSCI 490-K - Topics in Computer Science (Quality Assurance and Software Testing)
Instructor: Mona Rahimi
(Spring 2022)
###### Overview
To help students gain an understanding of principles and issues in software testing and analysis. Students will become familiar with various levels of testing such as unit, integration, system, performance, acceptance and stress testing. They will develop an understanding of test lifecycle planning, test design & coverage analysis, test case selection, and complexity measurements


## SIUe - Lost Files
###### Overview
This is a folder containing programming from my time at Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville. I learned to program in Java at my time there, so all the programs here are in Java. I used BlueJay and NetBeans to code all my projects.
