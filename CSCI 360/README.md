## CSCI 360 - Computer Programming in Assembler Language
Instructor: Geoffrey Decker
###### Overview
In-depth study of assembler language programming on a third-generation computer, including internal and external subroutines, conditional assembly, and the macro language. Students required to write a number of substantial programs. Extensive laboratory work.

Programmer's Note: Not too tough of a class, just hard to understand what is going on and what to do on assignments. Lots of examples given in class that showed us what to do, what happens etc. and was very useful in assignments. Last two assignments were brutal, and did not do too well on Assignment 8 due to difficulty in learning the material as well as problems at home.
